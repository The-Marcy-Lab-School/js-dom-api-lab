# DOM API Lab

## Objective

For this lab, you'll be recreating this simple [webpage](https://codepen.io/thuyanduong/full/jOMogvY). However, you are not allowed to manipulate the `index.html` or the `styles.css` files. You will need to code your entire webpage in your `index.js` file. You should manually create each DOM element you need, append them to the correct parent, and edit their attributes using the DOM API. You **should not use Element.innerHTML**. 

### Methods for you to use:

* ❌  [Element.innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML)
* ✅  [Document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
* ✅  [Node.appendChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)
* ✅  [ParentNode.append](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/append)
* ✅  [Element.attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes)
* ✅  [ElementCSSInlineStyle.style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style)
* ✅  Any other DOM API methods

You should use [this Code Pen](https://codepen.io/thuyanduong/pen/jOMogvY) to see the HTML and CSS that you will be re-creating using only JavaScript.  

## Directions

1. If this is a Practice Lab, fork this repository and clone down your forked repo. **OR**, if this is a Lab Assignment generated through Github Classroom, you do not need to fork and can clone down your personalized repo directly. 
2. Code your solution in `index.js`. Open the HTML file in your web browser as you're coding to see your work.
3. Stage, commit, and push your changes regularly.
4. If this is a Practice Lab, open a pull request into The-Marcy-Lab-School:master branch to submit. **OR**, if this is a Lab Assignment, copy the URL of this personalized repo and submit it through Canvas.
